# Advent of Code 2020
## Roberto's TypeScript attempt

## Structure

# TODO
[x] implement performance metrics
[ ] change linter to warn, not error, about unused code (it's annoying me)
[ ] refactor each day to implement an interface that index can use
[ ] implement sub commands, perhaps using Commander
[ ] try implementing a pre-star or file loading method
[ ] use async file reading

# Notes for each day
## Day 1
Initial implementation takes 264ms
Parsing in load function reduces time taken to 28ms

## Day 2
Time taken about 20ms

Would be good to have unit tests for the isPasswordValid() functions as well
